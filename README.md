# Pokemon TCG Finder

Web app for searching pokemon tcg products, including a store finder within New Zealand

## Features

- Search for cards by name and type
- View cards within a set
- View card details
- View current stock for New Zealand card stores

_Don't see your store?_  
Currently all stores have to be manually configured to work with this app, if there is a store that you think is missing, add a new issue with the store name, url and an example of 3 card urls and we will see if we can add it in.
